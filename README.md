The program starts by importing the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for data visualization.

This project aims to analyze the employee data of ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The analysis involves preprocessing the dataset, performing various analysis tasks, creating graphical representations, and providing insights gained from the analysis.

The program performs the following tasks;

**Preprocessing Steps**

Corrected the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency and integrity.

**Analysis Tasks**

1. Distribution of Employees Across Teams
Determined the distribution of employees across each team.
Calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
Visualized the distribution using a bar plot.
2. Segregation of Employees Based on Positions
Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.
Visualized the distribution across positions using a bar plot.
3. Predominant Age Group Among Employees
Identified the predominant age group among employees.
Visualized the age distribution using a bar plot.
4. Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure
Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
Visualized salary expenditure by team and position using bar plots.
5. Correlation Between Age and Salary
Investigated if there's any correlation between age and salary.
Visualized the correlation using a scatter plot.
Calculated the correlation coefficient.

**Graphical Representation**

For each of the five analysis tasks, appropriate visualizations were created to present the findings effectively. These visualizations include bar plots for distribution analysis and scatter plots for correlation analysis.

**Data Story**

**Insights gained from the analysis include:**

Distribution of employees across teams: Team A has the highest number of employees, followed by Team B and Team C.
Segregation of employees based on positions: Most employees hold the position of Analyst, followed by Manager and Programmer.
Predominant age group among employees: Employees aged 25-29 constitute the majority.
Team and position with the highest salary expenditure: Team C and the Analyst position have the highest salary expenditure.
Correlation between age and salary: There is a moderate positive correlation between age and salary.

**Additional Information**

The project was completed using Python programming language.
Pandas and Matplotlib libraries were utilized for data analysis and visualization.
Timely submission of the project was ensured to earn additional marks.
